# Introduction 

Bees have been around for many millennia, however in most recent times the hardworking colonies face many trials and tribulations due to various factors such as an extensive use of pesticides, loss of habitat â€“ mostly because of rapid urbanization, unusually warm winters that cause a shift in plant development etc. The importance of these insects in the process of pollination is undeniable, valid for both wild bees and honeybees, hence the rapid decline in the number of their colonies presents a problem not only on the more global level in the nature, but also to the world agricultural output economic value. 

Back in 2006, there was a huge decline in the honeybee population reported mostly in North America, which had a huge impact on the American honey agriculture. This decline was due to the Colony Collapse Disorder, a phenomenon reported in many countries and continents since 1998. 

Let's take a look at Wikipedia's definition of this phenomenon:

>>>  Colony collapse disorder (CCD) is an abnormal phenomenon that occurs when the majority of worker bees in a honey bee colony disappear, leaving behind a queen, plenty of food, and a few nurse bees to care for the remaining immature bees.

It is important to note that this phenomenon also causes the remaining hive colony to collapse. The cause of the decline of 2006 is probably to be found in hive diseases and pesticides harming the pollinators, as these two processes are highly correlated, though no real consensus was reached. Ever since the collapse, the American honey industry has been largely struggling. After the collapse the U.S. is forced to import large amounts of honey, more precisely 350 of the 400 million pounds each year, which is in stark contrast to this industries brilliant past when almost half the honey consumed was produced locally.

The dataset analysed here gives insight into honey production supply and demand in America by state from 1998 to 2012. This dataset does not provide any variables that might reveal causal relationships regarding colony collapse disorder, it is instead focused on honey production. However I find it important to mention such phenomenon, not only because it is of general importance, but also because it explains the decline in honey production.

# Research questions 

As the data set is fairly large, there's a number of different things one might focus on. After spending some time reading about honey production and also looking at this specific data set, the thing that marked my interest the most was the relationship between honey production and number of colonies through time. The questions I find most relevant regarding that would be the following: 

* *Which states have the most bee colonies?*
* *Which states produce the most honey?*
* *What happens to the rates of production over time?*
* *What about the prices, do they get higher over time?*
* *Are there any trends in honey production related to the number of colonies?*

This will be a simple exploratory data analysis on the production of honey in the U.S. focusing on the following hypotheses: 

**H0** - Number of bee colonies in any state has no impact on honey production.

**H1** - Number of bee colonies in any state has impact on honey production.



# Data analysis


Firstly, let's take a quick look at the data we'll be analyzing.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
honey <- read.csv("honeyproduction.csv")
head(honey)
```
Here's also a description of each column's content:

* *numcol*: Number of honey producing colonies, more precisely the maximum number of colonies from which honey was taken during the year.
* *yieldpercol*: Honey yield in pounds per colony.
* *totalprod*: Total production in pounds (numcol x yieldpercol).
* *stocks*: Refers to stocks in pounds held by producers.
* *priceperlb*: Refers to average price per pound, in dollars, based on expanded sales.
* *prodvalue*: Value of production in dollars (totalprod x priceperlb).

This dataset is rather rich in information. However the first thing I'd like to investigate further is the relationship between the states and number of honey producing colonies. Let's plot a box plot of state and numcol to verify this.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

ggplot(honey, aes(state, numcol))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = state), show.legend = FALSE)+
  labs(x="State", y="Number of honey producing colonies")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si())

```


Let's try finding outliers and eliminating them, so our boxplot makes more sense.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
Q <- quantile(honey$numcol, probs=c(.25, .75), na.rm = FALSE)
Q
iqr <- IQR(honey$numcol)
iqr
up <-  Q[2]+1.5*iqr # Upper Range  
low<- Q[1]-1.5*iqr # Lower Range
eliminated<- subset(honey, honey$numcol > (Q[1] - 1.5*iqr) & honey$numcol < (Q[2]+1.5*iqr))

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

ggplot(eliminated, aes(state, numcol))+
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = state), show.legend = FALSE)+
  labs(x="State", y="Number of honey producing colonies")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si())

```



As expected, the box plot shows differences between the states. Let's plot a histogram of 20 states with the highest number of bee colonies. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

honey %>% select(state, numcol) %>%
 group_by(state) %>%
 summarize(total = sum(numcol/10)) %>%
 arrange(desc(total)) %>% head(20) %>%
 ggplot(aes(reorder(state, -total), total, fill = state))+
 geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
 scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 50000, to = 550000, by = 50000))+
 labs(y = 'Number of colonies', x = 'States')+
 theme(legend.position = "none",
       panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
       axis.text.x = element_text(size = 13),
       axis.text.y = element_text(size = 13))
```

It appears that four states with the highest number of colonies are California(CA), North Dakota(ND), South Dakota(SD) and Florida(FL).


What are some other questions we could pose regarding the data set?
**Which states produce the most honey?**

To see this let's take a look at the total honey production in every state. We could plot that on a U.S. map. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)
honey <- read.csv("honeyproduction.csv")
plot_usmap(data = honey, values = "totalprod", color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "blue", high = "yellow", name = "Total production in lb", label = scales::comma) + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")


```

This plot looks lovely, but it's kind of hard to read. Let's plot 20 states with the largest production on a histogram. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

honey %>% select(state, totalprod) %>%
 group_by(state) %>%
 summarize(total = sum(totalprod/2000)) %>%
 arrange(desc(total)) %>% head(20) %>%
 ggplot(aes(reorder(state, -total), total, fill = state))+
 geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
 scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 250000, by = 25000))+
 labs(y = 'Honey production (in tons)', x = 'States')+
 theme(legend.position = "none",
       panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
       axis.text.x = element_text(size = 13),
       axis.text.y = element_text(size = 13))
```


In this plot we can see top 20 states in honey production, with North Dakota(ND), California(CA) South Dakota(SD) and Florida(FL) as the four major states producing honey. This adds up to what we've seen before, those were also the four states with the highest number of bee colonies. 

Finally, we could plot the change in total honey production over the period from 1998 to 2012, to see whether there was an overall increase or decrease depending on the state.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
honey %>% filter(year %in% c(1998,2012))%>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = totalprod/2000, y = reorder(state, totalprod))) + 
  geom_path(color = "red", 
            arrow = arrow(length = unit(1.5, "mm"), 
                          type = "closed")) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_number_si())+
  labs(title = "Change of Total Production from 1998 to 2012", 
       y = "State", x = "Production (tons)")
```

What we can see from this plot is that the total honey production decreases for most states, however only North Dakota (ND) recorded significant increase.

# Trends in data

We can also look at some existing trends in our dataset. **What happens to the rates of honey production over time?** because there is a huge drop of number of colonies existing, it should be expected that the total honey production is also dropping. Let's verify if that is correct. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
honey <- read.csv("honeyproduction.csv")

str(honey)
honey %>% select(year, totalprod) %>%
 group_by(year) %>%
 summarize(total = sum(totalprod/2000)) %>%
 ggplot(aes(year, total))+
 geom_smooth(method = "lm")+
 geom_line(lwd = 2, color = 'red')+
 geom_point() +
 scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1998:2012)+
 scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 70000, to = 110000, by = 5000))+
 ylab("Production (in tons)") +
 xlab("Years") +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1),
       panel.grid.major.x = element_blank())

```

As seen from the plot above, honey production has been decreasing over time. 
But **what about the prices?** We can expect that the price will increase over time. Let's verify that. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
honey <- read.csv("honeyproduction.csv")


price <- honey %>%
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(YearAvgPrice=mean(priceperlb))

 ggplot(data= price, aes(year, YearAvgPrice))+
 geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  geom_line(color = "red", size = 2) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(1998, 2012, 2)) +
  ylab("Prices (Avg)") +
  xlab("Years")

```



The plot confirms that the prices have been going up over the years. 


Finally, let's plot the number of colonies and honey production together, in order to observe their development over time.



```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
honey %>% select(year, numcol, totalprod) %>%
 group_by(year) %>%
 summarize(totColo = sum(numcol),
           totProd = sum(totalprod)) %>%
ggplot(aes(year))+
 geom_line(aes(y = totColo/25), lwd = 1.5, color = 'red')+
 geom_line(aes(y = totProd/2000), lwd = 1.5, color = 'blue')+
 theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15))+
 labs(y = 'Red = Number of colonies x 25, Blue = Production in tons')+
 scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 1998, to = 2012, by = 1))+
 scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 70000, to = 110000, by = 5000))
```


From this plot we can conclude that *as the number of colonies decreases, so does the honey production*. 

* Additionally, the number of colonies begins dropping from 1999, however the honey production is in a surge from 1999 to 2000.This is explained by the fact that honey can be collected even from collapsed colonies. However, as expected there was a huge drop in honey production in the period from 2000 to 2002, which is directly influenced by the collapsed colonies from 1999 onward. This pattern is found again in the period from 2006 to 2008.

* After 2008 up to 2010 the number of colonies increase rapidly, which leads to an increase in production.




# Conclusion


As we've seen in the previous sections, honey production is highly dependent on the number of bee colonies. The states that produce the most honey had the biggest number of bee colonies. Additionally, as the number of bee colonies dropped, so did the production of honey. We can safely reject our **H0** in favor of the **H1** - Number of bee colonies in any state has impact on honey production.
